![Mockup Screen Generator: Initial Landing Page Screenshot](assets/images/responsive.jpg)

From the ancient Chinese dynasty emerges a hand game that has traveled through the silk routes, sailed the seas, and spanned centuries to reach us: Rock, Paper, Scissors. Originally christened "shoushiling", this game wove its way into Japanese traditions as "jan-ken" before making its historic journey to the shores of Europe and America. Its simplicity charmed generations, and the game became a household name across continents.

But, like all great legends, it was destined for evolution.

Enter the 21st century, and the game is reborn with a twist, thanks to the ingenuity of Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. This dynamic duo introduced two cunning new characters to the mix: the Lizard and Spock! Their creation added layers of strategy, reduced the monotony of ties, and redefined the classic, giving it a fresh, modern feel.

While its origins may be humble, its claim to fame came under the limelight of Hollywood. The streets buzzed, social media trended, and living rooms laughed as Sheldon from "The Big Bang Theory" introduced the world to the intricate ballet of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Now, with the power of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, we bring this exciting game to your screens. Whether you're a nostalgic enthusiast or a new fan looking for a strategy-filled showdown, this game is designed for you!

>#### __3. High level summary on bugs and issues encountered:__

* __Logic Errors:__ <br>
  In the early development phase, logic errors were causing the game to have no response to player interaction when tested or produced incorrect winner determination or score updates. These issues were the result of trying to achieve to much to soon, thereby creating some very messy code structure, which was either not or poorly commented to help remember what does what and when it should. This lead to starting everything again and adopting a minimum viable product (MVP) approach to towards the games development, with better code structure, functions modular and much clear commenting to help keep track of things before git pushes.

* __Maintenance:__ <br> 
  I found myself not being very efficient when coding, resulting in repeated code being present in the codebase. This made code maintenance and picking apart problems a little harder than it needed to be and increased the likelihood of inconsistencies occuring. As my confidence grew, I adopted the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle to help minimize redundancy and avoid future problems. Especially if I would like to go back and further develop the game.

* __Game_Limitations:__ <br>
  Having taking a MVP approach to the development of the game, a limitation is its UI/UX, particularly on smaller mobile screens, which could do with further development.  

* __Unfixed bugs:__ <br>
  No unfixed bugs.
  
<br>

>#### 4. __Lighthouse assessment:__
* The open-source tool Lighthouse was used to provide insights and actionable guidance for improving webpage design by assessing its quality via five metrics: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, Search Engine Opitmization (SEO) and Progressive Web App (PWA). With particular emphasis during the project paid to accessibility to ensure the site is more accessible to users with disabilities.
