        <div class="container block-text">
          <h3><p>First there was Rock, Paper, Scissors! A traditional hand game 
            believed to have originated from China more than two millennia ago. 
            Whose original name was called "shoushiling" and is referenced in 
            historical texts dated back to the Han dynasty (circa 206 BCE 
            â€“ 220 CE). Where this game is thought to have then spread next to 
            Japan and become known as "jan-ken." Before it arrived in the late 
            19th to early 20th century in Europe and America through trade, 
            immigration and cultural exchange. However, it is only in more 
            recent years that a new variant has appeared, known as: 
            "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock", which is a modified version 
            of the game invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla sometime in the late 
            1990's to early 2000's. Where the game adds two more moves to the 
            traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game, which reduces the chances 
            of having a tie. As in essence, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock 
            adds more complexity to the traditional game by offering players a 
            greater range of moves and potential strategies. Thus, like the 
            classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, it is based on the principle 
            that each move defeats certain moves or can draw. Utimately though 
            this new variant of the game only truly become popularized after it 
            featured in the hit TV show, called: "The Big Bang Theory" in which 
            the character Sheldon explains and champions the game.
